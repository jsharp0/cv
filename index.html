        <p><em>Professional Website Developer</em></p>
        <p>I am a Computer Information Systems major at the University of Louisville, currently in my junior year. I have always been facinated with math and science, which has led me to pursue an interest in computers. I appreciate how computers can
          be
          useful for so many things, whether scientific or data-oriented or allowing the user to express a creative side. Given this ability, I have become familiar with many of the most popular tools that are important in today's information age. I
          have
          experience and expertice in using the Microsoft Office suite of products, but have especially enjoyed working with Excel. I also am familiar and experienced with photo and video editing, both of which are important to the modern consumer
          given
          the impact visuals can have on individuals. I am also experienced in such programming languages as HTML, C, and C++ <strong>(with more soon to come)</strong></p>
